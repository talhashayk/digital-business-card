			<h2>About</h2>
			<p>
				A passionate, driven and responsible individual that is
				confident in leadership and effective in communication. My
				inquisitive nature along with my intuition and creativity make
				for my greatest asset, the ability to adapt.
			</p>
			<h2>Interests</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<span>Art & Design:</span> Utilised as a creative outlet, I
					enjoy anything from sketching small doodles to producing
					large-scale, hand-painted pieces of custom clothing for
					clientele.
				</li>
				<li>
					<span>Staying Physically Active:</span> Partaking in
					weightlifting, callisthenics and bouldering is routine.
					Other forms of training such as football, boxing and muay
					thai are occasionally included to keep both the mind and
					body healthy and stimulated.
				</li>
				<li>
					<span>Technology:</span> The growth of this industry
					fascinates me and I take delight in following the evolution
					of mobile phones, computers and user experience design.
